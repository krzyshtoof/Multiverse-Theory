# Observable Predictions

- Possible anisotropies in CMB due to primordial entanglement patterns
- Sub-Planckian metric fluctuations from topological transitions
- Decoherence signatures in early quantum gravity models
- Virtual qubit clocks shifting under relativistic strain

Each could hint at the splintered fabric left by a pre-time quantum state.
