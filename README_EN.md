# Multiverse Theory

An interdisciplinary quantum-topological hypothesis exploring the origin and structure of the universe via a dual-world framework:
- **Temporal World** – our universe, originating from the evaporation of a white hole (interpreted as the Big Bang).
- **Atemporal World** – a timeless, immutable quantum structure that exists before and after our temporal universe.
