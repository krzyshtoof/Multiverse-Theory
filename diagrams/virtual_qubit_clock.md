# Diagram: Time Shifted Clock – Virtual Qubit Relativity Model

This diagram illustrates the conceptual structure of a virtual clock based on quantum entanglement and relativistic time shift.

---

## Components:

### 1. Axis `t_virtual`
Represents the internal time of an evolving virtual qubit. It is decoupled from classical observer time and may be altered based on state parameters.

### 2. Axis `t_observer`
The external, classical reference time for a local frame of reference. It is used to compare against the virtual state's evolution.

### 3. Arrow Δt
The time shift between local and "tunneled" time — caused by dilation effects or temporal entanglement.

### 4. Red axis (0 to 1s)
Represents classical 1-second interval measured in observer’s frame — serves as baseline for relative measurements.

### 5. Equation: `SAGC = velocity / gravity`
A model parameter expressing how dynamic system characteristics (velocity, mass, gravitational potential) influence time reading distortion.

## Applications:

- Simulating time dilation
- Modeling relational clock operators
- Analyzing time shifts in hybrid AI/classical systems
