# Analysis of Scripts from the `simulations` Directory – Ψ_connection Project

Below is an analysis of the contents of the `simulations` directory in the [Multiverse-Theory](https://github.com/krzyshtoof/Multiverse-Theory) repository.

## 1. `qqc.py`
- **Description:** Simulates a clock with alternating time offset.
- **Significance:** Demonstrates oscillatory time.
- **Contribution:** Prototype for emergent time mechanism.

## 2. `time_shift_clock.py`
- **Description:** Clock with a small offset in a separate thread.
- **Significance:** Models time drift.
- **Contribution:** Local variability of time – coherent with Ψ_connection.

## 3. `time_shifted_clock.py`
- **Description:** Minimal version of offset clock.
- **Significance:** Testing relative clocks.
- **Contribution:** Concept of quantum time irregularity.

## 4. `virtual_quantum.py`
- **Description:** Applies a NOT gate to a random qubit state.
- **Significance:** First model of quantum “tick”.
- **Contribution:** Basis for qubit-based clock.

## 5. `wodor.py`
- **Description:** Erroneous attempt to apply NOT to a scalar.
- **Significance:** Minimal; syntax experiment.
- **Contribution:** Very limited, more a draft.

## 6. `wodor2.py`
- **Description:** Models electron energy in hydrogen atom.
- **Significance:** Moves toward physical Ψ modeling.
- **Contribution:** Prototype of local state – the “thread”.

## General Conclusions
These scripts act as **experimental prototypes** of Ψ_connection concepts, especially in modeling **emergence and relativity of time**. While they don’t yet present dynamic entanglement networks Φ, they lay the groundwork for future formal implementations.
