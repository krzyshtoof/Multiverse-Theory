# Ψ_connection Overview

The Ψ_connection theory, developed by Krzysztof W. Banasiewicz, seeks to describe the Universe as a dual-layer system: classical spacetime and an underlying quantum, atemporal structure. It proposes that the Big Bang was the result of a white hole evaporation process, supported by a complex topological quantum space akin to Calabi–Yau manifolds.

It integrates Everettian many-worlds interpretation, general relativity concepts like black/white holes, and emergent spacetime arising from quantum entanglement.
