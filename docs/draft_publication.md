**Version:** Draft 0.1

## Abstract

This draft introduces a novel framework based on dual cosmological structures: a timeless atemporal domain and a temporal universe born from a white hole evaporation process. This interpretation aligns with elements of quantum gravity, topological modeling, and cosmological observations.

## Key Components

1. **Atemporal Structure:** Modeled as a Calabi–Yau-like manifold, enabling potential configurations of quantum origins.
2. **Wave Function Collapse:** The transition from atemporal to temporal state via quantum decoherence.
3. **White Hole Evaporation:** The Big Bang reinterpreted as an energetic transition from timeless quantum reality.
4. **Cycle Hypothesis:** Universe ends return to atemporality, possibly triggering new cycles.

## Implications

- Novel interpretation of initial conditions of the universe
- Potential explanation for observational anomalies in CMB
- Opens philosophical discourse on causality without time

## Future Work

- Mathematical formalization using quantum field theory in curved spacetime
- Numerical simulations of white hole evaporation
- Engagement with quantum information theory and entropy mechanics
