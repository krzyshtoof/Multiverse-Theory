# Atemporal Quantum Space

The underlying space of the Universe, according to Ψ_connection, is atemporal: it lacks directionality or flow of time. It is a high-dimensional, topologically rich structure that supports all potential quantum configurations. Emergent spacetime arises when certain configurations decohere.

Inspired by Calabi–Yau topologies and quantum foam theories.
