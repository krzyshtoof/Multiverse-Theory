## Introduction

Black holes and white holes are dual expressions of extreme spacetime geometry — one absorbs, the other emits. From an epistemological standpoint — concerning what can be known — they represent two polar boundaries of physical reality:

> **A black hole is the end of knowledge.  
> A white hole is the beginning of unknowing.**

## Epistemological Comparison

| Aspect                 | Black Hole                                  | White Hole                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Event horizon          | Prevents escape of signals                  | Prevents entry of signals                       |
| External observation   | Can observe falling objects "forever"       | Only visible as sudden emergence                |
| Internal observation   | Possible briefly (for infalling observer)   | Impossible — horizon rejects all entry          |
| Access to information  | Gradually hidden or evaporated              | Suddenly appears without observable cause       |
| Arrow of time          | Directed inward to singularity              | Directed outward into space                     |
| Causality              | Exists "before" horizon                     | No "before" — initiates time itself             |

## Relevance to Multiverse Theory

In the context of your theory:

- The **white hole marks the transition from an atemporal state to temporal emergence** — the collapse of the universal wavefunction.
- The inability to “see inside” the white hole mirrors the **absence of causal structure** in the atemporal domain.
- It’s not a technological limit. It’s an ontological one.

## Key Quote

> “We can look into a black hole — a little. But a white hole? Never. It’s only bursting outward.”

This observation captures not only physical asymmetry, but also the boundary of knowledge: the white hole cannot be observed **in its genesis**, because it **creates the condition for observation** — time itself.

## Conclusions

- **Black hole = limit of knowing by vanishing**  
- **White hole = limit of knowing by emergence**  
- In the multiverse model, the white hole is a **gateway to reality** that no external observer can describe — because **there is no outside yet.**
