# Emergence of Time via Decoherence

Time, in Ψ_connection, is not fundamental but arises through decoherence of a universal quantum state. The phase factor in Ψ (e^(−iEt/ħ)) represents this — time is phase, and events unfold through phase separation.

This view links to Page & Wootters’ mechanism of time from correlations.
