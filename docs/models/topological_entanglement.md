# Topological Entanglement and Φ

Φ(r', r) is proposed as a function describing the level of quantum entanglement between spatial points, effectively “weaving” the fabric of spacetime. It resembles a propagator or Green’s function but interpreted as an entanglement kernel.

Topological variation in Φ encodes geometry.
