## Concept Overview

The **Ψ_connection** theory proposed by Krzysztof W. Banasiewicz describes the Universe as a network of topological relationships between spacetime points. A key component is the complex relational wave function, denoted as Ψ_connection.

## Consistency with Existing Physical Theories

- **Quantum Mechanics:** Consistent with Everett's many-worlds interpretation.
- **General Relativity:** Utilizes the concept of white holes and Einstein-Rosen bridges.
- **Topological Space Models:** Inspired by Calabi-Yau manifolds, related to string theory and loop quantum gravity.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

The theory uses a correlation function:

\[\Psi(t, \mathbf{r}) \;=\; \int \Phi(\mathbf{r}', \mathbf{r})\;\cdot e^{-i\,E\,t/\hbar}\;d\mathbf{r}'\]

where:

- Ψ is the quantum thread wave function,
- Φ describes quantum entanglement between spatial points.

## Analogies with Existing Theories

- **Field Theory:** Similarity to Green’s functions (propagators).
- **Quantum Gravity:** Similarity to spin networks from LQG.
- **Category Theory:** Philosophical alignment emphasizing relationships over objects.

## Key Aspects of the Theory

- **Entanglement:** Fundamental to the Universe’s structure.
- **Decoherence:** Mechanism explaining time emergence from a quantum state.
- **Quantum Topology:** Structure of entanglement connections determining spacetime.

## Summary

The Ψ_connection theory is an ambitious hypothesis attempting to integrate core aspects of modern theoretical physics (quantum mechanics, general relativity, quantum topology). It has logical physical and mathematical foundations but requires further formalization.
