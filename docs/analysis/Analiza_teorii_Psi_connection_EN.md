Analysis

Conceptual Outline

The Ψ_connection theory, proposed by Krzysztof W. Banasiewicz, attempts to describe the Universe as a structure composed of two complementary “layers” — classical spacetime and an atemporal quantum space. In this framework, the birth of our Universe is associated with the evaporation of a white hole (i.e., a process reverse to the collapse of a black hole) — in other words, the Big Bang would be an example of a white hole explosion. The proposed atemporal quantum space is expected to have a complex topological structure (the author suggests an analogy to Calabi–Yau manifolds with additional dimensions). The entire description is based on the wave function of the Universe, denoted as $\Psi$, and a relational function $\Phi$, which together aim to account for quantum phenomena (such as entanglement) responsible for shaping spacetime. The theory is in an early conceptual phase and combines elements of quantum mechanics (Everett’s interpretation), general relativity (black/white holes), and the topology of space (Calabi–Yau manifolds, entanglement networks).

Compatibility with Existing Physical Theories

Quantum Mechanics:
The assumptions of Ψ_connection refer to Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, treating the Universe’s universal wave function as a real physical entity. This is consistent with one of the popular interpretations of quantum mechanics — the many-worlds view assumes the existence of an objective wave function of the Universe that evolves deterministically (without collapse) and contains all possible states. The Ψ_connection theory builds on this idea (the wave function of the Universe), but adds an element of collapse: it proposes that the collapse of the wave function could have been a physical event equivalent to the Big Bang. This last postulate introduces a certain interpretive inconsistency — in the pure Everett interpretation, no collapse ever occurs, whereas here a single distinguished “collapse” is suggested to generate spacetime. Nevertheless, the very idea of a global wave function remains within the framework of quantum mechanics; similar approaches appear in quantum cosmology (e.g., Wheeler–DeWitt) and in many-worlds models.

General Relativity:
The concept is partially inspired by relativistic cosmology — the idea of a white hole as the origin of our Universe is a hypothesis that occasionally appears on the fringes of scientific literature. Indeed, some physicists have speculated that the Big Bang might have been a white hole explosion (e.g., a “bounce” of matter collapsed into a black hole). White holes are allowed solutions of Einstein’s equations, although they have not been observed empirically and are generally considered unstable. Incorporating this idea into Ψ_connection lends it a certain connection to general relativity — it employs notions of black/white holes and spacetime tunnels (Einstein–Rosen bridges). However, aside from the concept of the initial singularity as a white hole, the theory does not provide a complete formulation of gravitational equations compatible with GR. Instead, it suggests that spacetime structure emerges from a quantum description (thus ultimately requiring a quantum theory of gravity).

Topological Models of Space:
Banasiewicz proposes that the atemporal quantum space should possess a rich topological structure — he uses an analogy to Calabi–Yau manifolds, which are compact, higher-dimensional spaces used in string theory to describe extra dimensions. This implies that, in the Ψ_connection theory, certain degrees of freedom (perhaps related to quantum entanglement) may reside in a space with more dimensions or special topology. Such an inspiration aligns with current unification efforts — for example, string theory posits hidden Calabi–Yau dimensions, while loop quantum gravity (LQG) employs discrete topological structures (spin networks) to describe space. Importantly, the author refers to topological models of universe formation and cyclicality, which echoes hypotheses of eternal multiverses or cyclic cosmologies (e.g., Penrose’s conformal cyclic cosmology). Overall, the foundations of the theory do not appear to conflict with current theories — rather, it is a collage of elements from existing, though often speculative, ideas in theoretical physics. Its consistency with physics depends on whether these elements can be unified into a single formalism — which remains an open question.

Mathematical Assumptions and Theoretical Formalism

The Ψ_connection theory aims to be grounded in well-defined mathematical objects, although at this stage they are more proposed constructs than fully formalized entities. The central component is the titular Ψ_connection function — understood as a complex relational function linking quantum states and geometry. In the project documentation, it is presented in the form of an integral equation:

\Psi(t, \mathbf{r}) = \int \Phi(\mathbf{r}{\prime}, \mathbf{r}) \cdot e^{-iEt/\hbar} \, d\mathbf{r}{\prime}

Here, $\Psi(t,\mathbf{r})$ is the wave function describing the quantum state of a “thread” (a gravitational filament) at time $t$ and spatial point $\mathbf{r}$, while $\Phi(\mathbf{r}’,\mathbf{r})$ represents entanglement interactions between points $\mathbf{r}’$ and $\mathbf{r}$, encoding the geometric-topological structure of the “thread”. Thus, $\Phi$ acts as a correlation (relational) function between points in space — it can be interpreted as a topological connection pattern (entanglement) of space. The phase factor $e^{-iEt/\hbar}$ introduces time dependence, suggesting that time has an oscillatory phase character and may be an emergent phenomenon arising from quantum evolution. In other words, all geometric relations are encoded in $\Phi$, and local spacetime dynamics emerge only when the temporal phase is considered.

Definitions of Mathematical Objects:
The author clearly identifies the fundamental quantities: in addition to the functions $\Psi$ and $\Phi$, we encounter the energy $E$ associated with the “thread” state and the spatial differential element $d\mathbf{r}’$, implying integration over all possible entanglement configurations. This outlines a configuration space: $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{r}’$ denote points (possibly both in ordinary spacetime and in atemporal quantum space). The adoption of a Calabi–Yau-type atemporal space suggests a mathematical assumption of extra dimensions or complex topological structure, although details (metrics, symmetry groups, etc.) are not yet provided. In general, at this stage, the theory indicates what types of mathematical objects will be used (manifolds, wave functions, configuration integrals), but does not yet present a complete formalism in the form of equations of motion or operators.

Formalism in Relation to Existing Theories:
The proposed equation formally resembles an expansion of an eigenfunction in a quantum system or a Feynman path integral, where $\Phi(\mathbf{r}’, \mathbf{r})$ plays the role of a kernel or propagator between spatial points. This indicates that the author seeks to give the theory a rigor similar to field theory: the proposed $\Phi$ could, in principle, serve as a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian encoded in entanglement space, and $\Psi$ as a solution to the Schrödinger/Dirac equation for the Universe. Indeed, it is suggested that this equation could form the basis for defining a spacetime propagator in quantum geometry and for deriving a field theory for gravitational threads. Plans to move to an operator formalism (quantization of $\Phi$) and to compare with existing approaches to quantum gravity such as spin networks/spin foam are also mentioned. This is significant, as it shows an awareness that entanglement networks structurally resemble spin networks known from loop quantum gravity — in both cases, space is described as a graph of connections (in LQG, nodes and edges carry quantum gravitational field values).

Assessment of Formalization Level:
In summary, the mathematical foundations of the Ψ_connection theory are still in development. The key components (functions, spaces, operator ideas) have been clearly identified, but they still need to be developed into a coherent set of equations. The project documentation indicates that this is a research program — extensions are planned (operator version of $\Phi$, numerical tests for different geometries). At this point, the theory is built on solid (though hypothetical) assumptions drawn from mathematical physics, but its formal construction remains more of a sketch than a finished framework.

Analogies to Existing Physical Theories

The description of Ψ_connection as a complex relational function $\Phi$ connecting points in space has many analogues in well-established physical concepts. Most notably, quantum mechanics and field theory have long employed correlation functions between points — for example, Green’s functions (propagators) $K(x, x’)$ or path integral transition amplitudes serve as the mathematical glue between events in spacetime. The function $\Phi(\mathbf{r}’, \mathbf{r})$ proposed by Banasiewicz resembles such a propagator, with the distinction that it is not interpreted as the result of a specific particle interaction, but rather as a measure of quantum entanglement between two regions of space.

There have been suggestions in the literature that the structure of spacetime might emerge from a network of quantum correlations — one example being the ER=EPR hypothesis (Einstein–Rosen = Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen), according to which every pair of entangled particles corresponds to a miniature spacetime tunnel (an Einstein–Rosen bridge). Although Ψ_connection does not directly reference ER=EPR, the idea of entangled “threads” connecting spatial points is very similar. One could say that $\Phi$ encodes the topology of entanglement connections — in other words, which regions of the Universe are quantum-correlated — and this, in turn, determines the geometry of macroscopic space. This perspective is consistent with a growing trend in theoretical physics that sees entanglement as the builder of geometry. For example, in the context of the holographic string theory, it has been shown that removing entanglement causes spacetime to disappear (a coherent spacetime appears only when a sufficient entanglement network exists).

Analogies can also be found in the domain of quantum gravity. As mentioned earlier, spin networks in loop quantum gravity are graphs whose edges carry units of the gravitational field (spin field) — geometrically, they correspond to “threads” of space (e.g., surfaces with certain areas). The Ψ_connection theory introduces the concept of “gravitational threads” (entanglement-based) and seems to construct a very similar picture: points (analogous to nodes) linked by $\Phi$-relations (analogous to edges). Furthermore, the author explicitly plans to connect his formalism with the spin-foam approach (sums over spin networks). This indicates that Ψ_connection is not in contradiction with LQG, but rather seeks to fill a gap: LQG describes the quantum geometry in detail, but lacks conventional quantum mechanics of matter — whereas here we find a rich description of the quantum state ($\Psi$) and entanglement relations ($\Phi$), which could complement spin networks with quantum information.

As for category theory in physics — this branch of mathematics offers a descriptive language based on objects and relations (morphisms) between them. A philosophical similarity can be observed: Ψ_connection emphasizes relationships (entanglement) between elements as fundamental, which resonates with the categorical approach, where the structure of a system arises from the configuration of morphisms. However, in practice, the theory does not explicitly employ categorical concepts (e.g., there are no functors or commutative diagrams in the description). Nevertheless, the relational character of the theory — the primacy of connections over individual objects — aligns with the spirit of modern physical approaches (e.g., Carlo Rovelli’s relational quantum mechanics also postulates that states are defined by relations between systems). Likewise, topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) use category theory tools to classify spaces via topological invariants — one could speculate that the “topology of entanglement” in Ψ_connection would play an analogous role as an invariant for the quantum structure of the Universe.

Repository Contents and Project Documentation

The Multiverse-Theory project on GitHub (author: @krzyshtoof) serves as an open repository containing documentation and (planned) code related to the Ψ_connection theory. The repository is organized thoughtfully, with materials divided into thematic folders:
	•	docs/ – Core Theory Documentation:
This folder contains text files (in Markdown format) that outline the theory’s assumptions, core ideas, and formal models. For example:
	•	assumptions/main.md describes the basic assumptions (the duality of spacetime and quantum space, origin from a white hole, etc.),
	•	concepts/ gathers the key concepts (e.g., starting_equation.md contains the aforementioned equation and its interpretation, a description of the thread wave function, and entanglement topology),
	•	models/ includes outlines of formal physical and mathematical models (e.g., emergent_time.md on the emergence of time via quantum decoherence, gravity_reinterpreted.md on the reinterpretation of gravity in this context, and quantum.md on quantum aspects).
	•	philosophy/ – Philosophical Considerations:
This folder explores issues such as the nature of time, causality, and eternity — aligned with the themes summarized in the README.
	•	predictions/ – Predicted Empirical Consequences:
For instance, it mentions potential anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) or sub-Planck-scale effects, as referenced in the README.
	•	diagrams/ – Visualizations:
This includes diagrams and conceptual illustrations. For example, the file conceptual_diagram.md likely describes the general framework of the theory, and images such as Time Shifted Clock Virtual Qubit Relativity.png suggest attempts to visually represent quantum and temporal dependencies (e.g., the “virtual qubit as a clock” concept). There are also paired files like virtual_qubit_clock.md in both English and Polish, indicating a commitment to bilingual documentation.
	•	notebooks/ and simulations/ – Computational Codes:
These folders are intended for computational tools.
	•	notebooks/ is planned to include notebooks (Python, Julia, Qiskit) for testing hypotheses,
	•	simulations/ is designated for numerical simulations (e.g., for studying phenomena like black hole mergers or other cosmological effects).
At present, the content in these folders appears to be minimal or under development — no fully functional simulations of the Universe have been found yet, which is understandable given the early conceptual stage of the project.
	•	Additional Materials:
	•	The file README.md (and its English version README_EN.md) summarizes the project, listing its assumptions, models, philosophical implications, and current status.
	•	There is also a file named draft_publication.md, which is likely a draft of a scientific publication — this suggests that the author intends to present the results in article form.
	•	A CITATION.cff file is included for citation data (though it’s currently more of a template), and a CONTRIBUTING.md file provides guidance for potential contributors.
	•	The reviews/ folder includes praise_and_feedback.md and a collection of quotes in fortunes, possibly intended for feedback or inspirational scientific sayings.

The entire repository is licensed under MIT (for the code) and CC-BY-4.0 (for the documentation), indicating a commitment to openness and transparency.

Conclusions from Repository Analysis:
The project is being conducted with a high degree of diligence regarding documentation — the author clearly aims to record every aspect, from assumptions through formalism and predictions to the philosophical context. Many files are still short or in draft form, which is understandable at the “early conceptual phase.” There are no explicit references to external publications (no bibliography), aside from general mentions of Everett interpretation, ER bridges, etc., which suggests that the theory is the author’s original idea but built upon widely recognized concepts in physics. The repository does not (yet) contain a working implementation of the Ψ_connection simulation, but rather serves as a platform for developing the theory — potentially with the aim of attracting other researchers (#HackTheUniverse).

Entanglement, Decoherence, and Quantum Topology – Key Aspects

Quantum Entanglement plays a central role in the Ψ_connection theory — it is, in fact, its very foundation. The function $\Phi(\mathbf{r}’, \mathbf{r})$ defines the degree of entanglement (quantum correlation) between different regions of space. This construction makes entanglement responsible for “stitching together” the fabric of the Universe. This perspective aligns with a growing belief in theoretical physics that entanglement builds space: in recent years, many papers have argued that space and time may emerge from networks of quantum correlations between fundamental degrees of freedom. As one such model metaphorically puts it — without entanglement, there would be no space, just as without threads, no fabric is formed. In Banasiewicz’s theory, the “threads” are precisely entangled states — the topology of entanglement determines the topology of spacetime.

Moreover, the author refers to “topological models of cyclic universes,” suggesting that different global entanglement configurations might correspond to different universes within a multiverse (perhaps these spaces can connect or arise from one another through changes in the entanglement pattern). This notion of quantum topology (understood here as the structure of the entanglement network) is innovative, but it resonates with ideas already present in other frameworks — e.g., BF topological field theory or the ER=EPR model, both of which assign fundamental significance to loops, knots, and links (in the contexts of gravity or wormholes). The repository explicitly highlights entanglement topology as a separate concept to be developed, which emphasizes the author’s conscious treatment of entanglement as a topological structure.

Decoherence and the Emergence of Time:
The Ψ_connection theory assumes that classical spacetime (with a time arrow) emerges from the atemporal, quantum description through a mechanism analogous to quantum decoherence. Decoherence is the process by which quantum coherence is lost due to entanglement with the environment — it leads to the apparent reduction of states (i.e., classical measurement outcomes) without the need to assume wave function collapse a priori. The project documentation contains a module dedicated to the emergence of time and decoherence, suggesting that the author is exploring ideas proposed, for example, by Donald Page and William Wootters (time as an emergent phenomenon from quantum correlations between subsystems).

Also, in the Ψ equation mentioned earlier, time appears only in the phase factor $e^{-iEt/\hbar}$, while the entire spatial architecture resides in $\Phi$ — time is not a fundamental parameter, but rather a result of quantum phase dynamics. One may interpret this as follows: as long as the system remains in a “pure” atemporal superposition, time does not flow; but when entanglement loops form (perhaps an analogue of measurement or interaction with a meta-environment), classical spacetime appears, and with it, the experience of temporal passage.

In the Ψ_connection framework, Big Bang = collapse of the Universe’s wave function, which may be linked to the idea that this moment marked the decoherence of the universal state — the emergence of a single branch (ours) from among many quantum possibilities, and thus the birth of time and classical space. While this may sound exotic, it aligns with ongoing discussions in quantum cosmology: how to explain why our Universe has a well-defined history (one of many potential ones), and why quantum fluctuations in the early Universe became differentiated (a topic connected to inflation and decoherence).

The Ψ_connection theory attempts to answer: because a phase transition occurred — from an atemporal superstate to a decohered classical state.

Quantum Topology

In the context of the Ψ_connection theory, this term refers — as previously mentioned — to the structure of entanglement connections that determine the shape of the Universe. However, one can take a broader view — if the theory were to be formalized, it might provide a topological description of the multiverse. Perhaps a topological invariant (similar to classifiers in knot theory) could be constructed to describe each universe through the pattern of $\Phi$ connections. Such an approach would be reminiscent of cobordism categories in topological quantum field theory, where different universes (manifolds) are connected by processes (cobordisms).

Although this remains speculative for now, Ψ_connection strongly emphasizes the topological aspect — even its title refers to a “topological connection pattern.” In practice, this might mean that only quantities invariant under topological transformations are physically meaningful — not the specific metric, but rather the way in which entanglement threads are interwoven. This would be consistent with the spirit of quantum gravity, where absolute metrical structure loses its meaning, and only topological invariants of networks matter (as in LQG, where volume and area are quantized, and the continuum of space is replaced by a discrete graph structure).

Conclusion

Does Ψ_connection have physical and mathematical foundations?
To summarize the analysis, this concept is an ambitious attempt to combine elements of quantum mechanics and general relativity into a unified framework. It draws upon well-established theoretical ideas (Everett’s multiverse, quantum entanglement, white holes as a cosmological hypothesis, topological manifolds), so at the level of assumptions, it does not contradict physics — instead, it builds on it creatively.

Its mathematical basis is outlined: specific functions, spaces, and a formalism plan are identified (an equation connecting $\Psi$ and $\Phi$, with analogies to propagators, spin networks, etc.), though it remains a work in progress. Conceptual consistency with modern physics appears to be preserved — the theory seeks, for example, to explain the origin of time (an open problem in quantum cosmology) or how to reconcile entanglement with geometry (echoing the idea that spacetime emerges from entanglement entropy). Many details, however (e.g., exact evolution laws, the Hamiltonian of the Universe, collapse mechanism), remain undefined.

There are numerous and deliberate analogies to existing theories: Ψ_connection can be seen as a bridge between the language of quantum information (entanglement, decoherence) and cosmological structure (spacetime, gravity). The author seems consciously to integrate diverse perspectives — as reflected in the project structure and references to Everett, topology, or LQG in the development roadmap.

At this stage, the Ψ_connection theory is a working hypothesis — an intriguing but untested scenario. Some of its speculative predictions (e.g., subtle anomalies in the CMB or Planck-scale fluctuations as traces of the Universe’s quantum entanglement) may, in the future, serve as observational touchpoints, but for now they remain theoretical. Nevertheless, this approach has value: it attempts to consolidate several deep problems (quantum gravity, the measurement problem, the origin of the Universe) into one conceptual framework.

The physical reality of Ψ_connection has not yet been verified — but the construction is based on known theoretical elements and thus maintains a logical connection to the current state of knowledge (even if it extends it speculatively). The documentation and repository show that the assumptions are clearly formulated, and the author is actively working toward their mathematical and computational development.

Time will tell whether Ψ_connection evolves into a coherent theory capable of producing new, testable results — or remains an intriguing, yet unverified philosophical-physical concept. For now, it is a bold, interdisciplinary idea drawing from quantum mechanics, relativity, and quantum topology — one that seeks to address fundamental questions about the nature of time, space, and information in our Universe.
